    ### Content

    The `poster_details` element holds heading text and a call-to-action, which are designed to scale with the pattern. Image composition should be considerate of the content's shape. It can be deleted for image-only usage.

    Image-only assets where you compose the text and graphics should include a clear heading and (one) call-to-action.

    - Content should be optimized for viewing on a small screen.

    - Don't use small text or graphics (they won't be readable on mobile devices).

    - Don't use more than 20% text.

    - Graphics must be sharp with no visible compression artifacts.

    - Graphic compositing must be professional quality.
